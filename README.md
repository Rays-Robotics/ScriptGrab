# ScriptGrab - Experimental Beta (GUI Edition)

> **Warning:** This is an **experimental beta branch** featuring a fully interactive Whiptail-based GUI for managing your scripts.  
> **Bugs may be present.** If you prefer a stable experience without potential graphical glitchesâ€”and a smaller footprintâ€”please switch to the [main branch](https://github.com/Rays-Robotics/ScriptGrab) which only includes the CLI version.  
>  
> **Note:** This GUI version is substantially larger than the CLI-only version due to the additional graphical interface and enhanced dependency support.

**ScriptGrab** is a lightweight and powerful script manager designed to make downloading, managing, and running shell scripts a breeze. The latest experimental version features a fully interactive Whiptail-based GUI for **all** user interactionsâ€”no more typing multiple commands!
